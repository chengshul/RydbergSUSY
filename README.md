# RydbergSUSY
numerical results on the emergent supersymmetry in a Rydberg ladder system

## Calculation scripts
`dmrg.jl` is used to explore the ground state phase diagram and obtain the entanglement entropy and correlation functions, with `dmrg_p0.jl` initializing the sweeping.

## Plotting scripts
`plot.py` plots the order parameter and fits the central charge for each parameter, which is used to obtain the phase diagram, generated by `pd.py`. `plot_boundary.py` plots the central charge and the scaling dimensions along the phase boundary. `plot_corr_tci.py` plots the correlation functions at the tricritical point.
